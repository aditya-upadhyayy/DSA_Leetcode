Purpose: The function modifiedList removes nodes from a linked list if the node's value is found in the provided vector nums.

Input: It takes two inputs:

nums: a vector of integers that represents the values to be removed from the list.
head: the head (starting point) of the linked list.
Set Conversion: It converts the nums vector into an unordered set (st) to speed up lookups when checking if a value should be removed.

Head Node Removal: It first checks if the head node's value is in the set. If so, it deletes the head node and moves to the next node until the head points to a node not in the set.

Iterating through the List: It then moves through the rest of the list, starting from the updated head, checking each node's value.

Deleting a Node: If a node's value is in the set, the node is skipped by adjusting the next pointer of the previous node and deleting the node to free memory.

Return: Finally, the function returns the updated linked list, with all nodes containing values from nums removed.

In summary, this function removes nodes from the linked list if their value exists in the nums list.
